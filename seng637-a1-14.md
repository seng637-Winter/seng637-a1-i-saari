# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

The exploratory testing will cover a wide range of operations mirroring the extent of operations defined in the specification. Tests will follow procedures a normal person might perform when using the ATM. Most ATM functions will be used in a way they are intended to be used. The specification will guide the procedures used in the exploratory tests.

Tests will begin by starting the ATM and loading it with $1000. Then the following actions will be performed:
1. Cash withdrawal cash and review account balance
1. Deposit cash, review account balance and print receipt
1. Attempt to withdraw more cash than held in the account
1. Enter an incorrect PIN
1. Cancel a withdrawal transaction 

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

The exploratory testing revealed more bugs than the manual functional testing, though many would have been found by the MFT if they hadn't already been recorded. During exploratory testing, more edge cases like accidental button presses were tested, since the manual functional test cases were not very extensive. The MF test cases were useful for testing the specified functionality, but not unexpected cases.
